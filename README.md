# SimpleCoffeeMachine

A coffee machine script using Python programming would be a program that simulates the functionality of a real-world coffee machine. The script would allow a user to interact with the machine and make different types of coffee by following a set of instructions.

The script would start by importing any necessary modules or libraries, such as those for user input or controlling hardware components.

Next, the script would have various functions that simulate the different actions of a coffee machine such as brewing a coffee, adding sugar and milk, and dispensing the coffee. Each function would be triggered by the user input, for example, selecting a certain type of coffee from a menu.

The script also include features such as displaying the available coffee options, keeping track of the number of coffees dispensed, and monitoring the machine's inventory of beans, water, and other supplies.

Overall, the script would provide a simple and user-friendly way to control the coffee machine and make different types of coffee.
